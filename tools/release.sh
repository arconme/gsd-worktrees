#
# A helper: changing VERSION by hand in a commit on main does the same.
#
# 1. Checks: on main, clean, level with origin/main, X.Y.Z newer than VERSION,
#    and CHANGELOG.md has a "## X.Y.Z" section (write it first — it becomes the
#    release notes).
# 2. Writes VERSION and commits "release vX.Y.Z".
# 3. With --push: pushes main. GitHub Actions (release.yml) sees VERSION change,
#    runs every test suite, tags the commit and publishes the release;
#    install.sh / gsd-update pick it up from there. Without --push it prints the
#    push command.
