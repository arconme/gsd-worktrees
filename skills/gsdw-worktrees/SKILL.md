description: "The gsd-* shell commands that run GSD phases in parallel git worktrees — gsd-start, gsd-finish, gsd-list, gsd-doctor, gsd-init, gsd-bootstrap-repo, gsd-planning-repair, gsd-update. Use when asked to start/begin/pick up a feature or phase, to finish/land/ship a phase, to see what phases exist or what is in flight, to set GSD up in a repo or start a new project (gsd-init, never a bare /gsd-new-project or /gsd-ingest-docs), or to diagnose a broken .planning/ or worktree. These are shell commands run via Bash, distinct from the /gsd-* planning skills."

# gsd-worktrees — the shell commands around GSD

GSD's provider-native planning skills do the planning. This toolkit does everything around
them: one-command feature start/finish, a git worktree per phase, parallel-safe
phase claims, and provider-neutral command guards. Commands live in `~/.local/bin`; toolkit repo
is `arconme/gsd-worktrees`.

Only relevant in a **GSD-fitted repo** — one with `.gsd.conf` and `.planning/`.
Check with `ls .gsd.conf .planning` before assuming. If it isn't fitted, the
answer is `gsd-init`, not a manual setup.

**Never run `/gsd-new-project` or `/gsd-ingest-docs` in a repo without
`.gsd.conf`.** Run `gsd-init` in the terminal instead: it installs the
toolkit's files first, then opens a session that runs the right one of the
two. Run alone, they write the plan without that setup. Claude has a
user-level hook (from `install.sh`) that blocks it; Codex has no hooks, so
there this rule is the only guard.

**GSD skills that clash with worktrees.** In a GSD-fitted repo the guard
blocks these (Codex: these rules are the guard). Use the toolkit command:

| Don't run | Why | Run instead |
|---|---|---|
| `/gsd-autonomous` | every phase in one checkout; skips review, validate, secure | `gsd-start` per phase, then `/gsdw-flow` |
| `/gsd-manager` | several phases as background agents in one checkout | `gsd-list`, then `gsd-start` per phase |
| `/gsd-workspace`, `/gsd-workstreams` | GSD's own isolation fights the toolkit's | `gsd-start -n "<desc>"` |
| `/gsd-phase` (add), `--insert` | the claim is not pushed (number races), ROADMAP rows missing | `gsd-start -n` / `gsd-start --insert <N>` |
| `/gsd-phase --remove` | renumbers later phases that may have worktrees | only when `gsd-list` shows no later phase in flight |

`/gsd-phase --edit` is fine, on the base branch. Not blocked, but take care:
`/gsd-ship` opens a PR without `gsd-finish`'s gates — use `gsd-finish --pr`
(`/gsd-pr-branch` is fine: `gsd-finish --pr` uses its `-pr` branch).
`/gsd-complete-milestone` and `/gsd-cleanup` reshape ROADMAP.md and move phase
folders — only on the base branch with no phase in flight. `/gsd-quick` on the
base branch lands code without `gsd-finish`'s checks — use it inside a phase
worktree. For "what next", trust `gsd-flow-next` over `/gsd-progress`.

## The rule that matters most

**Never claim a phase without checking first.** Run `gsd-list`, read it, and
decide:

| The work is… | Command |
|---|---|
| already a phase in the roadmap | `gsd-start -p <N>` (attach) |
| genuinely new | `gsd-start -n "<description>"` |
| a hotfix under an existing phase | `gsd-start --insert <N> "<description>"` |

`gsd-start "<description>"` with no flag is **refused** — deliberately. A bare
description used to claim, which made it far too easy to restate existing work
in fresh words and get a second phase for it. State the intent explicitly.

With `--ticket <id>`, a phase already tagged with that ticket (`tk-<id>`) is
also refused however differently it was worded — that phase *is* this work.

With a tracker set (`tracker = clickup|custom` in `.gsd.conf`), a new claim
(`-n`, `--insert`) **needs a ticket**: `--ticket <id>`, or a `tk-<id>` tag in
the description. Ask the user for the ticket. Use `--no-ticket` only when the
user says no ticket covers the work.

## The loop per feature

1. `gsd-start -n "<desc>"` — claims a uniquely-numbered phase in `ROADMAP.md`
   (deterministic, auto-renumbers on a race with a parallel session), pushes
   the claim, creates `../<repo>-worktrees/phase-<N>-<slug>` off the base
   branch, and prints a safely quoted command for the configured provider.
2. **Relay that one-liner to the user** to run in a fresh terminal. Do not open
   a nested session, and do not do the phase work in the current session.
3. Select `--flow` on the start command above, or use the installed `gsdw-flow` skill in the new session. It
   resumes the step reported by `gsd-flow-next <N>`. Without `--flow`,
   `gsd-start` begins at discussion; invoke the later steps through the
   provider's actual skill mechanism. The engine is authoritative for order.
4. After the engine reports `done`, tell the user the phase is ready to land.
   Run `gsd-finish` only on explicit user request, from the phase worktree,
   as the session's **last** action: it removes that directory after merging.

## Commands

| Command | Use |
|---|---|
| `gsd-list [--compact]` | Read-only table of every phase: number, description, plan progress, lifecycle stage, worktree state. **Run this before starting anything.** |
| `gsd-start` | `-n "<desc>"` new · `-p <N>` attach · `--insert <N> "<desc>"` decimal hotfix · `--ticket <id>` tracker ticket (tags `tk-<id>`; required for a new claim when a tracker is set) · `--no-ticket` · `--slug` · `--repo <path>` · `--provider <name>` · `--agent-command <path>` · `--model <id>` · `--flow` / `--no-flow` · `--launch` / `--no-launch` (opens the session by default in a terminal; from an agent's shell, with no terminal, it only prints) · `--no-push` |
| `gsd-finish [<N>]` | Land the phase. No argument = infer from the current worktree branch. Runs the repo's pre-merge check or its test suite first. `--pr` opens a GitHub PR instead of merging (worktree stays; re-run after it lands). |
| `gsd-doctor` | Read-only health check: toolkit install, shims, `.planning` merge safety, planning-file coherence, worktree hygiene. Diagnoses only — each finding names the command that fixes it, with a code; `--json` for scripts. No `--fix`, by design. |
| `gsd-init` | Repo with no GSD → ready for `gsd-start`. Use `--providers claude,codex` for a provider set and `--provider codex` to choose the planning session. In a terminal it opens that session (`/gsd-new-project` / `/gsd-ingest-docs`); from your shell (no terminal) it prints the command — have the user run it, or run the printed skill in this session. |
| `gsd-bootstrap-repo` | Just the file installation `gsd-init` wraps. Idempotent. |
| `gsd-planning-repair` | Reconcile `ROADMAP.md` + `STATE.md` after a union merge, recompute counters. `--check` = CI guard, `--commit` = land the repair. Runs automatically from `gsd-finish` and the `post-merge` hook. |
| `gsd-update` | Install the newest toolkit release (keeps the chosen agents), then the latest gsd-core. `--check` only compares versions; `--no-core` skips gsd-core. |

Every command self-documents: `gsd-start --help`, `gsd-finish --help`, ….
Prefer them over chaining the manual steps — they carry parallel-session race
handling the manual path lacks.

## Rules that bite if ignored

- **One feature = one phase = one worktree.** Configured providers may hand the
  same phase between sessions. Never run simultaneous mutating sessions in the
  same folder or branch. Never feature work in the main checkout.
- **Touch only your own phase** in `ROADMAP.md` / `STATE.md`. Never renumber or
  edit someone else's. Merges auto-resolve via the `merge=gsd-planning` driver.
- **The command-level guard blocks misplaced or premature commands** (phase
  setup off the base branch, per-phase commands outside their
  `phase-<N>-*` worktree, execution before install completion). Follow the
  reported prerequisite; location is only one possible cause. The guard runs
  through supported GSD shell routes; arbitrary direct shell commands can
  bypass those routes. `GSD_SKIP_GUARD=1` bypasses it; use only when the user
  asks. Claude's native hook provides optional early feedback.
- **With `flow = strict` in `.gsd.conf` the guard also enforces the phase
  order.** `/gsd-plan-phase` needs the discuss artifact (`<P>-CONTEXT.md`),
  `/gsd-execute-phase` needs the cross-AI review (`<P>-REVIEWS.md`; `--gaps-only`
  exempt), `/gsd-secure-phase` needs the code review (`<P>-REVIEW.md`), for a
  phase with a UI-SPEC `<P>-UI-REVIEW.md`, and the test audit
  (`/gsd-validate-phase`: `<P>-VALIDATION.md` compliant or audited). A block names the step to run first.
  Do the step; never work around it.
- Repo settings live in `.gsd.conf`. `scripts/gsd-*.sh` are frozen shims that
  delegate to the toolkit — never edit them.

## When something looks wrong

Run `gsd-doctor` first and report what it says. In a `flow = strict` repo it
also lists every merged phase that skipped a mandatory step (T040) — that is
the backlog, not something to fix from the main checkout. `.planning/` looking
contradictory after a merge is the known failure mode — `gsd-planning-repair
--check` confirms it, `--commit` fixes it.
