"""gsd_hook_paths.py — find GSD hooks that point at files that are gone.

An agent runs a hook whose program is missing as a failed command, and most
events show nothing: the guard or monitor just stops running. The usual cause
is a path written in at install time that a later upgrade moved (GSD's
installer bakes in the absolute node path; nvm, Volta, fnm and asdf keep each
version in its own folder, so the next Node upgrade orphans it).

Usage: gsd_hook_paths.py <scope>:<settings file> [--project <dir>] ...
  scope = user | project (where the fix is run: --global or --local)
  --project <dir> applies to the files after it: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR expands
  to <dir> there.

Prints one line per missing file, tab-separated:
  <settings file> <scope> <owner> <hook> <event> <missing path>
owner = toolkit (our gsd-worktree-guard) | gsd (any other gsd-* hook);
hook = the hook's number in its file, so one hook missing two files counts once.

Only GSD hooks count: a command is checked when one of its words names a
gsd-* program or script. Everything else in those files (the user's own
hooks, other tools) is left alone. Only absolute paths are checked; a bare
name (node, bash) resolves on the hook's PATH, which this cannot see, and a
word holding any other $VARIABLE is skipped. Reads files only; a missing or
unreadable file is skipped.
