"""
gsd_planning.py — reconcile GSD planning files after a union-style merge.

`.planning/ROADMAP.md` and `.planning/STATE.md` carry a union merge strategy so
parallel phase sessions can each append their own entries without conflicting.
Union is right for append-only content and WRONG for every line that is a single
source of truth: when a phase branch flips a line that the base branch also
changed, union keeps BOTH sides and the file starts contradicting itself.

This module reconciles the both-sides result back to one coherent file.

    reconcile   Fix ONE file in place. Structural only — no counter is
                recomputed, because a merge driver runs mid-merge when the rest
                of the tree is not yet consistent. Conflicting counters resolve
                to the most-advanced candidate; `repair` fixes them properly.

    repair      Fix .planning/ROADMAP.md + STATE.md AND recompute every derived
                counter from ground truth: phases from the roadmap, plans and
                summaries from disk. Idempotent. With --check it writes nothing
                and exits 1 if either file needs repair.

Two rules the reconciliation is built on, both learned from real corruption:

  * Keyed content (checklist entries, table rows, phase detail sections) keeps
    the position of the key's FIRST occurrence and the content of its BEST
    occurrence — "[x]" beats "[ ]", a real status beats "Not started", and among
    equals the longer text wins because it carries the "(completed <date>)"
    suffix. Keeping the later line instead would reorder phases out of sequence.

  * Single-value fields resolve to their LAST occurrence, because
    `git merge-file --union` emits ours-then-theirs inside a conflict hunk, so
    the last copy is the incoming branch's value. This is verified against real
    merges — see tests/fixtures.

Deduplication of single-value fields is always SCOPED to the block that owns the
field. STATE.md's "## Session Continuity" section is never touched: its
`Last session:` / `Stopped at:` / `Resume file:` lines are one entry per past
session and legitimately repeat. A global "keep the last occurrence" pass would
silently delete real history.
